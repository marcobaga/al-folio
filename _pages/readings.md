## ML/RL papers

I often run into publications that I really enjoy reading. Whenever a paper is beautifully written, or contains stimulating ideas, I might add it to this personal list.

## novels and non-fiction

Here is a few books that I particularly enjoyed, in no particular order.

- J. Steinbeck, **The Grapes of Wrath**:

 the book I would recommend to most people.
- P. Godfrey-Smith,  **Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness**:

a curious book that deals with curious animals. 
- T. Kidder, **The Soul of A New Machine**:

an inquisitive peek on regular people involved in the computer revolution.
- A. Tabucchi, **Pereira Maintains**:

a calm and beautiful novel.
- D. Adams, **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy**:

needs no introduction.

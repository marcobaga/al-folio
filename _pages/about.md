## bio

I am a PhD student at MPI-IS and ETH Zürich, co-advised by Georg Martius and Andreas Krause. I am mainly interested in (deep) reinforcement learning. Previosuly, I was fortunate to spend some time at the <a href="https://ait.ethz.ch/">AIT Lab</a> (ETH Zürich), under the supervision of Prof. Otmar Hilliges, and in the <a href="https://al.is.mpg.de/">Autonomous Learning Group</a>.

Not so long ago, I obtained a MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zürich, and a few years before that I graduated from Politecnico di Milano (BSc in Engineering of Computing Systems).

## research

My current main focus is on (deep) reinforcement learning, and I enjoy researching or learning about any related idea. In particular, my interests include exploration, temporal abstraction and offline approaches. In the long term, I aim to contribute to the understanding of current RL methods, and I am really excited about finding ways to tackle to rich, open-ended environments.

Outside of RL, I have some experience in representation learning and causality, and I like keeping an eye open towards other topics in machine learning or robotics.
